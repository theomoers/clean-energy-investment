# Clean Energy Investment Causal Forest Analysis

> April 2024 <br>
> Columbia University, SIPA <br>

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theomoers/clean-energy-investment.git
cd clean-energy-investment
# activate env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the analysis
The code is developed for jupyter notebooks. It can also be run using the .py files but there are some longer processes that take quite long. It is easier to circumvent those by using the notebooks.

### Key dependencies
```numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, geopandas, cartopy, us, scikit-learn, econml, statsmodels, linearmodels, scipy, tqdm, requests, censusdata, textwrap```
